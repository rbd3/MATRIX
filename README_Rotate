Problem: Matrix Rotation

Write a function that takes a square matrix (an n x n matrix) as input and rotates it 90 degrees clockwise. You should modify the input matrix in place.

For example, if the input matrix is:

csharp
Copy code
[
  [1, 2, 3],
  [4, 5, 6],
  [7, 8, 9]
]

After rotating it 90 degrees clockwise, the modified matrix should be:

[
  [7, 4, 1],
  [8, 5, 2],
  [9, 6, 3]
]
