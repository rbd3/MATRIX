Problem: Matrix Transposition

Write a function that takes a matrix (a 2D array) as input and returns the transposed matrix. The transposed matrix is obtained by swapping rows and columns, effectively flipping the matrix along its main diagonal.

For example, if the input matrix is:

csharp
Copy code
[
  [1, 2, 3],
  [4, 5, 6],
  [7, 8, 9]
]

The transposed matrix would be:

csharp
Copy code
[
  [1, 4, 7],
  [2, 5, 8],
  [3, 6, 9]
]
